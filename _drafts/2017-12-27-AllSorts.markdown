```
Computer Science, actually that's a terrible way to start, first of all its not a science,
         it might be engineering or it might be art. Its also not very much about computers.
         -Harold Abelson

For some reason or another, a common starting place for computer science education is sorting algorithms.
Everyone has to learn them, but before getting to the [fun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Efficient_sorts) sorts, it is common to teach the $$O(n^2)$$ ones.
The Three being Insertion Sort,
```c++
for( int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++ )
{
   j = i;
   while( j > 0 )
   {
      if( arr[j] > arr[j-1] )
      {
         swap(arr[k], arr[k-1]);
      }
      j--;
   }
}
``` 
Selection Sort, 
```c++
for( int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++ )
{
   int mindex = i;

   for( int j = i+1; j < arr.size(); j++ )
   {
      if( arr[j] > arr[mindex] )
      {
         mindex = j
      }
   }

   if( mindex != i )
   {
      swap(arr[k], arr[k-1]);
   }
}
```
and Bubble sort.
```c++
for( int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++ )
{
   for( int j = i; j < arr.size(); i++ )
      if( arr[j] > arr[j-1] )
      {
         swap(arr[k], arr[k-1]);
      }
}
```

But what if I told you there were not three diffrent sorts here, but instead a single mechanism with 3 diffrent ways of approaching it?

Imagine if you will a node that takes in two inputs and returns two outputs,

<img class="centered" style="background-color: gray; border-radius: 25px; padding: 20px" src="{{ "/assets/posts/sorts/node.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="The Sorting Machine">

with output 1 less than output 2.
It is easy to see that given any two inputs what this node will return is a sorted list of two elements.
