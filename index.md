My name is Zachary Owen, I'm a Computer Science graduate from [South Dakota School of Mines and Technology](https://www.sdsmt.edu/). I like computers, tea and vim keybindings.

I've always been of the opinion that, to an outside observer, the difference between knowledge I cannot articulate and knowledge I do not have is essentially null. As such, the purpose of this blog is to articulate the things I know and am learning. I hope at least one other person finds something here informative.
